Rule: Processing a Task List

# Purpose

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files (in `/project/tasks/`) to track progress on completing a PRD.

# Check status

When the programmer starts a new conversation and asks that you follow this guildeline document, first check the status of the task list in /project/tasks/`, to bring yourself up to date, so you know where to continue.

# Task Implementation

- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you start a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as "in progress" by changing `[ ]` to `[.]`.  
  2. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` or `[.]` to `[v]`.  
  3. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[v]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

# Task List Maintenance

Update the task list as you work:
- Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[v]`) per the protocol above.
- Add new tasks as they emerge.

# AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[v]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[v]` once **all** its subtasks are `[v]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
